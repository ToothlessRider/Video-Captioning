# Video Captioning :video_camera:
Video Captioning :video_camera: is an encoder-decoder mode based on sequence to sequence learning. It takes a video :film_strip: as input and generates a caption :memo: describing the event in the video.

The importance of captioning :memo: lies in its ability to make video :movie_camera: more accessible in numerous ways. An automated video caption generator 🤖 helps searching of videos in websites better. It can be used for clustering of videos based on their content easier.

This project is something I've built as a part of my Deep-Learning 📚 course as requested by our professor 👨‍🏫, for us to familiarize ourselves with various concepts within the subject, which include manipulation of high-dimensional data 📊 (such as videos 🎥) and extraction of information from them.
